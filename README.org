gerbil-postgresql : A Gerbil Package for interacting with the Postgresql database system


* Introduction 

We use gerbil, gerbil has a postgresql dbi. We interact with
postgresql and gerbil.

* Usage 

We want to connect to a database. We want to use an external file to
store password information.  Pgpass to the rescue! [[file:doc/pgpass.org][See here for
details]].

#+BEGIN_SRC gerbil 
  (import :drewc/postgresql/pgpass)

  (find-password user: "foobar")
  ;; => "ecm- colon : backslash \\ a1sd"
#+END_SRC

In reality, we do not want to find the password every time, we want it
automated. [[file:doc/connect.org][~connect~]] , using pgass!

#+BEGIN_SRC gerbil 
  (import :drewc/postgresql/connect)

  (connect user: "ecm" port: 5434)
  ;; => #<postgresql-connection #30>
#+END_SRC
